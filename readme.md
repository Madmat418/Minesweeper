Minesweeper
-----------

A standard minesweeper game, played within the terminal.
To play, download files and then type "ruby Minesweeper.rb" within the project directory.
You will be prompted to enter a size for the game board.  This will create a square grid.  
For instance, entering "9" will create a 9x9 grid.
You will then be asked to enter a number of bombs, which will be placed on the grid after the first move, meaning it is impossible to lose on the first turn.
Make a move by typing 'r' or 'f' for reveal or flag and then the location you wish to perform this action on.
Examples: 'r [4,5]', 'f [3,3]'

Program features to be implemented:
-error catching for input of size of board and number of bombs
